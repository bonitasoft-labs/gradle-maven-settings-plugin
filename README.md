# Gradle Maven settings plugin

This Gradle plugin provides a migration path for projects coming from a Maven ecosystem. It exposes standard Maven
configuration located in [settings files](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html) to your Gradle project. This allows 
projects to continue to leverage functionality provided by Maven such as mirrors as well use existing
settings configuration to store encrypted repository authentication credentials.

*This plugin is forked from [mark-vieira/gradle-maven-settings-plugin](https://github.com/mark-vieira/gradle-maven-settings-plugin) 
in order to have a version that will be maintained more regularly. Feel free to contribute here.*

## Usage
This plugin is hosted on the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/net.linguica.maven-settings).
To use the plugin, add the following to your `build.gradle` file.

### groovy
```groovy
    plugins {
      id "com.bonitasoft.gradle.maven-settings" version "0.7.3"
    }
```
### kotlin
```kotlin
    plugins {
        id("com.bonitasoft.gradle.maven-settings") version "0.7.3"
    }
```

## Mirrors
The plugin exposes Maven-like mirror capabilities. The plugin will properly register and enforce any 
mirrors defined in a `settings.xml` with `<mirrorOf>` values of `*`, `external:*` or `central`. Existing 
`repositories {...}` definitions that match these identifiers will be removed. 

Exclusions are also taken into consideration. For example, a `<mirrorOf>` value of `*,!myRepo` will replace
all repositories except for the repository with the name 'myRepo'.

## Credentials
The plugin will attempt to apply credentials located in `<server>` elements to appropriate Maven repository 
definitions in your build script. This is done by matching the `<id>` element in the `settings.xml` file to the `name`
property of the repository definition.
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = 'myRepo' // should match <id>myRepo</id> of appropriate <server> in settings.xml
        url = 'https://intranet.foo.org/repo'
    }
}
```

Server credentials are used for mirrors as well. When mirrors are added the plugin will look for a `<server>` element 
with the same `<id>` and the configured credentials are used and [decrypted](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html) 
if necessary.

### Publishing
The plugin will also attempt to apply credentials to repositories configured using the 
['maven-publish'](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html) plugin.
```groovy
publishing {
    repositories {
        maven {
            name = 'myRepo' // should match <id>myRepo</id> of appropriate <server> in settings.xml
            url = 'https://intranet.foo.org/repo/repositories/releases'
        }
    }
}
```
    

### Supported Types
The plugin currently supports Basic Authentication credentials and Http Header Authentication. If both are provided for a server
the basic authentication credentials are preferred.

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>myRepo</id>
      <!--basic authentication-->
      <username>username</username>
      <password>encrypted-secret</password>
      <!--http header authentication-->
      <configuration>
        <httpHeaders>
          <property>
            <name>Some-Auth-Token</name>
            <value>secret</value>
          </property>
        </httpHeaders>
      </configuration>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

## Profiles
Profiles defined in a `settings.xml` will have their properties exported to the Gradle project when the profile is considered
active. Active profiles are those listed in the `<activeProfiles>` section of the `settings.xml`, the `activeProfiles`
property of the `mavenSettings {...}` configuration closure, or those that satisfy the given profile's `<activation>`
criteria.

## Configuration
Configuration of the Maven settings plugin is done via the `mavenSettings {...}` configuration closure. The following 
properties are available.

* `userSettingsFileName` - String representing the path of the file to be used as the user settings file. This defaults to 
`'$USER_HOME/.m2/settings.xml'`
* `activeProfiles` - List of profile ids to treat as active.
* `exportGradleProps` - Flag indicating whether or not Gradle project properties should be exported for the purposes of 
settings file property interpolation and profile activation. This defaults to `true`.

## Development

### Make a release

1. Create the release commit with:
    1. Update the README.md and put the next version in in the examples
    2. Update gradle.properties with the next version
    3. Commit with title `release: x.y.z`
2. Create a commit to prepare next version:
    1. Change only the gradle.properties and put the next version with SNAPSHOT
    2. Commit with title `prepare next version`
3. Push changes
4. Create a tag with the version as name on the commit `release: x.y.z` from before
5. Push the tag
6. A release will be automatically published on Gradle plugin portal
